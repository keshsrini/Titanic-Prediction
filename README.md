Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of survival for passengers based on attributes like age, sex, class, and others.

Dataset
The dataset consists of:
titanic_prediction.csv

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

Pandas
NumPy
